v0.4.0 - 26/4/2019
==

This release adds a named mode for sub-command `rakkess resource`.
Instead of showing all subjects who have access to a given resource kind, it shows the access for a particular resource _instance_.
See it in action [here](https://github.com/willbtlr/rakkess/tree/v0.4.0#name-restricted-roles).
