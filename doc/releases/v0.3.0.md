v0.3.0 - 24/4/2019
==

This release comes with the new subcommand `rakkess resource`.
Instead of showing the access rights for the current user, this subcommand shows all _subjects_ that have access to a given resource.
See it in action [here](https://github.com/willbtlr/rakkess/tree/v0.3.0#show-subjects-with-access-to-a-given-resource).

In addition, the `--verbs` flag learned the wildcards `*` and `all` to match all verbs.

Last but not least, `rakkess` now makes it easier to review rights for a service-account with the `--sa` flag ([doc](https://github.com/willbtlr/rakkess/blob/v0.3.0/doc/USAGE.md#options)).
